# Creating WhatsApp stickers using the API from the top-rated movies according to IMDb.

This application is integrated with the IMDb API, which compiles a list of the 250 best movies. Based on this, the application generates multiple images by blending a base image with the cover images of the movies generated by the list. To achieve this, an image with the parameters similar to those of the other images in the list is used.
